# Simple Neural Network From Scratch based on MNIST dataset

Build a simple neural network with and trained it on the **[MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/overview)** digit recognizer dataset.

The purpose of this project is for self studying.

## Goal

Build a _**two layer**_ neural network. Train the model with MNIST data set. Trained model is able to recognize(classfy) digits from _**0 to 9**_.

Also, we evaluate the model accuracy.
